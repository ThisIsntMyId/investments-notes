# Mutual Fund

1. Fund cats on Caps (large, mid and small) (6-7 yrs in mid cap > large cap)
2. Incepetion date (old is better for better data)
3. PE ratio (expense ratio) fees to fund manager for managing funds 
	eg: 10k/mon with 15% roi and 1.2pe after 25yrs => 2.63 cr 
	eg: 10k/mon with 15% roi and 0.5pe after 25yrs => 2.99 cr 
4. Lockins (except tax savers), else pay exit load of requested before time period
5. alpha (activa and passive aka copy index fund managed mf) => show how mf compared to the benchmarked mf
6. beta show the riskiness of mf compared to its benchmark (only shows RELATIVE RISK. not OVERALL RISK)
7. Standard Deviation (more sd more range of return aka more volatile) should be aprox to its peers
8. Sharpe Ratio (MF return - Risk return) / Standard Deviation	=> shows how much can a fund can generate additional return by taking additional risk
9. Fund Performance => how much competence a fund is compared to its peers
10. Fund Managers Track Record (how does the team manages other fund)


# Growth vs IDCW (Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal)
Growth 	=> invests profit via interest, dividends and capital gains from shares and security  in mf back
		=> good for fincial goal or wealth creation
		=> tax is applicable on redempetion only
IDCW 	=> returns the profit on regular time periods
		=> less nav compared to growth
		=> periodical returns from investments
		=> payouts and reinvestments
		=> can be liable for taxes once idcw is declared + tds on amt > 5k idcw
